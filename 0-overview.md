Suppose you are a developer for a ski resort. You need to create a page to allow customers to view the available options for a vacation package. The data resides in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file, which will be loaded at runtime. You want to ensure you don't need to modify the code when the JSON file is updated.

For this project you decide to use Svelte, a front-end JavaScript framework. Svelte allows you to add logic to a page to iterate through data and perform boolean logic to determine what should be displayed to the user. It also provides support to run asynchronous functions to load data and perform other operations.

In this module you will learn how to:

- use await blocks to call asynchronous functions
- use each blocks to iterate through data
- use if blocks to implement boolean logic

Prerequisites:

- Ability to write HTML and JavaScript
- Basic understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript
- Experience using `fetch`
- Experience creating a Svelte application
