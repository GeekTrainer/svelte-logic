Suppose you are a developer for a ski resort. You need to create a page to allow customers to view the available options for a vacation package. Typically data is loaded dynamically, so you don't want to update the page whenever the data is modified.

For this project you decide to use Svelte, a front-end JavaScript framework. Svelte allows you to add logic to a page to iterate through data and perform boolean logic to determine what should be displayed to the user.

In this module you will learn how to:

- use each blocks to iterate through data
- use if blocks to implement boolean logic

Prerequisites:

- Ability to write HTML and JavaScript
- Experience creating a Svelte application
