Loading information from a server through an API call and displaying it on a page is a common requirement for full-stack applications. In this module you explored how to use `if`, `for` and `await` blocks to enable this functionality.

In this module you learned how to:

- use await blocks to call asynchronous functions
- use each blocks to iterate through data
- use if blocks to implement boolean logic
